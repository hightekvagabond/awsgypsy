Points to Optimize:

1) Lean Function

	Avoid fat monolithic funcionts
	Control the dependencies in function
    	optimize for your language (Node: Browserfy, Minify)
        Lambda procsses a single event per container
	no need for nonb locking execution on the front end
	containers are reused, lazy load variables in global scope
	DON'T LOAD IT IF YOU DON'T NEED IT
	seperate lambda handler from core logic
	use functions transform not transport data
	read only what you need, query filters in amazon aurora, use s3 select
	tune your compute memory to only what you need
   	get aws-lambda-power-tuning to tune settings
	Don't bother with orchestration in your code: split into multiple functions instead with step functions


2) Eventful Invocations

	Sussinct Payloads, resilient routing, concurrent exicustiuon
	chose a good entry point
	discard uninteresting events asap
	

3) Coordinated Calls

4) Serviceful Operations
