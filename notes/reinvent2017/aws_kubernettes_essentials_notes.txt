follow Kellsey Hardtower's blog to learn the internals of what is going on "Kubernetes the hard way"

Master Node has:
	- API Server  (auth over TLS, rest via http)
	- Scheduler
	- Controler Manager  (you set desired state, it keeps it)
	    - Flags: Cloud Provider (native integration for ELB, EBS, ECR, VPC), 
	- etcd for persistent state


Kubectl:
	- CLI
	- SDK
	   - Python
	   - GO



NODES:
	- runs kubelet (the agent, talks to the API server on master)
	- runs kubeproxy







Kube2IAM lets you assume role to a pod

EKS will include multimaster across multi region, and it will manage etcd

containers in a POD can talk to each other, and are scheduled together
Has application contianer, and side car containers that do things like monitoring

ECS calls a POD a task


All Clusters need to be seperatly deployed per region/vpc

Pod is a super container





Know: Replica Sets and Deployments


Namespaces are good for multitenancy

HELM does package management



Calico helps enforce policys for security within k8

Flannel does an overlay network to avoid the limit for the VPC routing table
