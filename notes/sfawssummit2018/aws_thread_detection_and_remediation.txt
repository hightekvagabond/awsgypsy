use Cloudtrail to track every users activity and api usage

vpc flow logs show the network traffic

cloudwatch logs is for storing logs, monitoring, and access

dns logs are an input for gaurd duty

cloudwatch logs can have subscriptions to anylize real time feeds of logs, so that lambda functions can auto remediate (as an example)

Amazon GuardDuty is for threat detection for aws accounts and ec2 instances

Amazon Macie is a tool for watching your data and threats related to it

Guard Duty watches for known threats and does anomaly detection then generates a "finding"

Guard Duty has multi account support

Macie uses Natural Language Processing to detect and understand the data, it also givese alerts for unusual activity

Macie allows you to set up alerts for serachings for sensitive data with rules, such as filese with credit card numbers older than 6 months

Macie only supports s3 and cloudtrail for now, but will expand to other data stores soon

AWS Config rulese tracks your config changese that violate your rules

Cloud WAtch Events triggers for lambda auto remediation

AWS Shield Advanced - stops DDOS and Targeted attacks and such

AWS WAF - web security rules for the application

usee the edge serevices with WAF rules as much as possible to protect your core data

cloudfront is a great way to avoid DDOS

WAF allows you to count interesting patterns that happen so you can see whats happeneing and how often

aws.amazon.com/solutions/latest/aws-waf-security-automations/welcome.html

AWS Lambda for responsing

AWS Systems Manager automatically patches and poractivly mitigate threats and the instance level

Advisary -> enviroment -> cloudwatvh event -> lambda responder

in guard duty you can "generate samples"for building automation

when creating an event in cloudwatch to turn back on cloudtrail if it gets turned off you are watching for the Specific Operations of StopLogging and DeleteTrail
