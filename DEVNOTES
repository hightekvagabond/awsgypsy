these are notes for myself to pick up where I left off while working on this in case I have a gap in time between working on it

To make install easier I've created: ~/.aws/awsgypsy/setup_defaults

it looks like this (except profile and account are both actually there):

{
	"delete_old" : "y",
	"skip_prompts" : "y",
	"setup_ui" : "y",
	"githubbranch" : "work",
	"account" : "830xxxxxxxxx",
	"profile" : "830xxxxxxxxx",
	"region" : "us-west-2"
}

Don't try to work from your mac, use an ubuntu ec2 instance


make sure these libraries are installed:  boto3, sys, getopt, calendar, time, json, zipfile, os, shutil, Repo


make sure you have admin with your profile to that account

make sure virtualenv is installed


before merging to master always run ops/build_artifacts.py

pip install gitpython
